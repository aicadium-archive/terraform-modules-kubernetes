# Prometheus Adapter

Installs the [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter)
for the Custom Metrics API. Custom metrics are used in Kubernetes by
[Horizontal Pod Autoscalers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
to scale workloads based upon your own metric pulled from an external metrics provider like
Prometheus.
